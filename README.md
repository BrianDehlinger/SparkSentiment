# SparkSentiment
Apache Spark and Sentiment Anaylsis. 

This project will utilize several open source technologies and utilize Natural Language Processing(NLP) to analyze a large dataset in real time. Apache Spark will be utilized to carry out the analysis in memory to achieve critical speedups. Visualization of the dataset will be done as well and analyzed data will be stored in a Postgresql database. 

The main focus of this project will be to gain hands on experience designing and presenting an end-to-end solution to a big data problem. 
Ideally, this will showcase my skills in software engineering, data visualization, and design in general.

Technologies for consideration:

Spark Streaming
Apache Kafka
SparkML
Postgresql
Dash - for dashboard visualization creation

AWS may be utilized to access broader resources.
