# SparkSentiment

Apache Spark and Sentiment Anaylsis of the 61 United States National Parks in Real Time on Twitter. The main focus of this project will be to gain hands on experience designing and presenting an end-to-end solution to a big data problem. Ideally, this will showcase my skills in software engineering, data visualization, and design in general.

# Technologies for consideration:

### Chosen

```
Elasticsearch - For ease of use, indexing abilities, and easy queries
```

### Considering

```
Kibana - For easy integration with elasticsearch.
Plotly - For nice visualizations
Dash - For dashboard visualization creation.
```

### Also Considering

```
Spark Streaming
Apache Kafka
MLLib
Postgresql
Dash - for dashboard visualization creation
AWS
```

# Status

The rapid prototype was a success and was done using a tutorial. The program at this moment takes a hardcoded input to search as a term on Twitter. The results are then fed to elasticsearch on a docker container. The data is then fed to Kibana for visualization in real time. The program is fully functional. 

# Goals

```
More Natural Language processing
Kibana vs Plotly/Dash
Visualize Data on National Parks
```
