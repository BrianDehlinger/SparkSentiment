# SparkSentiment

Apache Spark and Sentiment Anaylsis of the National Parks in Real Time on Twitter. The program uses 

*The Dataset is best stored in a Elasticsearch database for easy and fast real time dashboards. 

The main focus of this project will be to gain hands on experience designing and presenting an end-to-end solution to a big data problem. 
Ideally, this will showcase my skills in software engineering, data visualization, and design in general.

Technologies for consideration:

## Chosen

```
Elasticsearch - For ease of use, indexing abilities, and easy queries
```

## Considering

```
*Kibana - For easy integration with elasticsearch.
*Plotly - For nice visualizations
*Dash - For dashboard visualization creation.
```

## Also Considering

```
* Spark Streaming
* Apache Kafka
* MLLib
* Postgresql
* Dash - for dashboard visualization creation
* AWS
```

The rapid prototype was a success and was done using a tutorial. The program at this moment takes a hardcoded input to search as a term on Twitter. The results are then fed to elasticsearch on a docker container. The data is then fed to Kibana for visualization in real time. The program is fully functional. 

Now the goals are:

1) Adding more interesting natural language processing capabilities with NLTK and other natural language processign toolkits.
2) Comparing Kibana and Plotly/Dash 
3) Visualize data on all of the national parks in the United States in real time on a Dashboard. This is challenging because there are a
