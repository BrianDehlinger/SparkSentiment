# SparkSentiment
Apache Spark and Sentiment Anaylsis. 

The Dataset is best stored in a Elasticsearch database for easy and fast real time dashboards. 

The main focus of this project will be to gain hands on experience designing and presenting an end-to-end solution to a big data problem. 
Ideally, this will showcase my skills in software engineering, data visualization, and design in general.

Technologies for consideration:

Chosen:
Elasticsearch - For ease of use, indexing abilities, and easy queries

Heavily considering:
Kibana - For easy integration with elasticsearch.
Plotly - For nice visualizations
Dash - For dashboard visualization creation.


Also considering:
-Spark Streaming
-Apache Kafka
-MLLib
-Postgresql
-Dash - for dashboard visualization creation
-AWS may be utilized to access broader resources.

The rapid prototype was a success and was done using a tutorial. The program at this moment takes a hardcoded input to search as a term on Twitter. The results are then fed to elasticsearch on a docker container. The data is then fed to Kibana for visualization in real time. The program is fully functional. 

Now the goals are:

1) Adding more interesting natural language processing capabilities with NLTK and other natural language processign toolkits.
2) Comparing Kibana and Plotly/Dash 
3) Visualize data on all of the national parks in the United States in real time on a Dashboard. This is challenging because there are a
